		The first medical staff to evaluate a patient suspected of having a stroke, needs to obtain key
		information that will help determine what treatments are available for the patient. Basic level
		triage includes obtaining the specific time the patient was last known well or the time of onset.
		It is important to note, if the patient wakes up from a stroke with new symptoms or is found down,
		the time of onset is not known. Therefore, you must use the last known well, even if this means the
		time they went to bed the night before. If possible, try to obtain a phone number for any witness
		or first-degree relatives from the EMS providers in case they are delayed in making it to the hospital.
		Often, their input is critical in some of the decisions that are made about treatment.It is also important
		to obtain a history of recent events; including whether the patient has suffered a stroke, heart attack,
		trauma, episode of bleeding or has had recent surgeries.The emergency room provider also needs to try to
		get a past medical history; information like a history of seizure, high blood pressure, diabetes or
		even previous stroke is valuable information that will help determine how best to treat the patient.
		Sometimes, it is difficult to obtain a complete past medical history; therefore, reviewing medications can
		help piece together the history and identify potential contraindications to certain treatments.
